In this folder my Number Two Html file and all its other versions are svaed. 
lately in the mentioned file I was struggling with some problemsm, including:
setting the right width and path for elements and giving suitable css properties to my background image so I can have a totally 
responsive website.
I've been slowed so much by this matter for the last ten days and yet I'm not on a satisfying point. Although tonight I managed to
fix and adjust the images in the way that suits my design. So for now I decided to postpone this projet and its big importnat
isssue for a while so that I'm not crippled by an issue, I'm gonna move forward, hone my skills and maybe comeback later to work
on this file if needed.
